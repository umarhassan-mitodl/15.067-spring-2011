Text and Assigned Readings
--------------------------

There is one principal text for the course: _The Mind and the Heart of the Negotiator_ by Leigh Thompson, Prentice-Hall, Fourth Edition, 2009. Leigh Thompson's book is very easy to read and full of informative vignettes and practical advice about how to prepare, what to do at the bargaining table and how to be strategically creative. Chapters are well organized and mostly self-contained. We ask that you read Chapter 1, "Negotiation, The Mind and the Heart" in advance of the first class. Chapter 2 offers valuable advice about preparation for negotiations. Chapter 3 addresses distributive bargaining – "split the pie" cases - and lays out basic concepts that we tap throughout the course. What to do at the bargaining table and how to be creative and expand the pie for all are covered in Chapters 4 through 8. The oft-asked question "How should I behave at the bargaining table?" is addressed in Chapter 5.
